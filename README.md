# FMCHNE
A slot machine game written in C++ for the Qt framework

# Prerequisites
QT - You must have QT installed on your computer. Google an installation tutorial if you do not know how.

cmake (for building only)

# Installation
Check relases and download the executable and the .png image (for the logo, so make sure they are both in the same folder) (No .exe file just yet) and run the executable. (Will generate a game_save.json file in the folder)

git clone https://github.com/ChaosTheChaotic/FMCHNE.git
cd FMCHNE
cmake --build build/Desktop-Debug --target all
```
# Credits
